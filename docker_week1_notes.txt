
# Week 1 Refactoring - Additional dependencies
# Add these to your existing Dockerfile requirements.txt installation

# Note: Your existing Docker setup doesn't need to change!
# The Flask app remains in UI/ directory, but now imports services from parent directory.

# For development/testing (optional)
# RUN pip install --no-cache-dir pytest pytest-cov black flake8 mypy

# For enhanced export functionality
# pandas and openpyxl are already in requirements.txt
