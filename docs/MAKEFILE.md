## üîç Command Details

### **make test-mode**
Starts PondMonitor in testing mode with simulated data:
- Copies `.env.testing` to `.env`
- Starts Docker Compose services
- No USB hardware required
- Generates realistic simulated sensor data
- Displays helpful information and URLs

### **make prod-mode** 
Switches to production mode with real hardware:
- Creates production configuration
- Requires USB LoRa device connected
- Uses Docker Compose with production overrides
- Disables simulation and testing flags

### **make health**
Performs comprehensive health checks:
- Tests Flask API endpoints
- Shows Docker container status
- Verifies service connectivity
- Displays JSON health response

### **make show-data**
Displays recent sensor data from database:
- Shows last 10 station metrics (temperature, battery, signal)
- Shows last 10 pond metrics (water level, outflow)
- Useful for verifying data collection

### **make debug**
Comprehensive debugging information:
- Docker Compose command being used
- Container status and health
- Docker images and volumes
- Environment variables (sanitized)
- Recent service logs

### **make clean**
Cleanup Docker resources:
- Stops all containers
- Removes containers and networks
- Prunes unused Docker system resources
- Keeps data volumes intact

### **make reset-db**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Destructive Operation** - Resets database:
- Confirms before proceeding
- Stops all services
- Removes data volumes
- Deletes ALL collected data
- Use only for development/testing

## üê≥ Docker Compose Detection

The Makefile automatically detects your Docker Compose installation:

```bash
# Modern Docker Compose (plugin)
DOCKER_COMPOSE := docker compose

# Legacy Docker Compose (standalone)
DOCKER_COMPOSE := docker-compose
```

You can see which command is being used:
```bash
make help
# Shows: Using: docker compose
```

## üìä Database Operations

### **Interactive Database Shell**
```bash
make shell-db
# Opens: psql -U pond_user -d pond_data

# Useful SQL commands:
\dt                          # List tables
\d station_metrics          # Describe table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM station_metrics;
```

### **Data Inspection**
```bash
# Recent sensor data
make show-data

# Current Redis cache
make show-redis

# Database backup
make backup
# Creates: backups/pond_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql
```

## üîß Customization

### **Environment Variables**
The Makefile respects these environment variables:

```bash
# Custom serial port
export SERIAL_PORT=/dev/ttyUSB1
make prod-mode

# Custom Docker Compose command
export DOCKER_COMPOSE="docker compose"
make up
```

### **Adding Custom Commands**
Add to `scripts/makefile`:

```makefile
my-custom-command: ## Description of custom command
	@echo "Running custom command"
	# Your commands here
```

## üö® Troubleshooting Make Commands

### **Common Issues**

**Command not found:**
```bash
# Check if make is installed
which make

# Install make (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install build-essential

# Install make (macOS)
xcode-select --install
```

**Docker Compose issues:**
```bash
# Check Docker Compose
make help
# Shows which command is detected

# Manual override
DOCKER_COMPOSE="docker-compose" make up
```

**Permission errors:**
```bash
# Fix script permissions
chmod +x scripts/start-testing.sh
chmod +x scripts/test_week1.sh

# Fix Docker permissions
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in
```

### **Debugging Make Commands**

```bash
# Verbose output
make -n test-mode    # Dry run (show commands without executing)
make -d test-mode    # Debug mode (show make decisions)

# Check Makefile syntax
make -f scripts/makefile --dry-run
```

## üìö Integration with Other Tools

### **IDE Integration**
Many IDEs support Make integration:

**VS Code:**
- Install "Makefile Tools" extension
- Commands appear in Command Palette

**JetBrains IDEs:**
- Built-in Make support
- Run configurations for Make targets

### **CI/CD Integration**
Use in GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Run tests
  run: make test

- name: Build and test
  run: make quick-start && make health
```

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### **Development Tips**
- Use `make quick-start` for fastest setup
- Keep `make test-logs` running during development
- Use `make health` to verify everything is working
- Run `make test` before committing changes

### **Production Tips**  
- Always backup before production changes: `make backup`
- Use `make debug` for troubleshooting
- Monitor with `make logs` in production
- Test production mode in staging first

### **Maintenance Tips**
- Regular cleanup: `make clean`
- Monitor disk usage: `docker system df`
- Update dependencies regularly
- Keep database backups: `make backup`
